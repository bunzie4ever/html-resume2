    <h1>Hobbies and interests</h1>

    <p>
        I have this problem. I can't stick to one hobby! Some might call me a jack of all trades, master of none 
        ... and they would be right lol. I love to explore new hobbies and interests. They just tickle a different 
        part of my brain. There are some hobbies that come back and visit from time to time, so I think it would only
        be fair if I listed those, as well as my current interests
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Visual art</li>
        <li>Crochet</li>
        <li>Music</li>
        <li>Reading</li>
        <li>Research</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        In an effort to remain mysterious, I'll keep my hobby list very brief. If you'd love to find out more
        about the hobby or you share a similar interest, feel free to <a href="./contact.html">contact me</a>.
